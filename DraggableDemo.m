function DraggableDemo(demotitle, mode)
%{
This function is a demo for the draggable.m function and should be distributed
along with it. It basically presents some of draggable.m"s features: users of
draggable.m are invited to read dragdemo"s source.

>> dragdemo(demotitle, mode);

runs the demo which title is contained in the string demotitle. Mode determines
whether to use axes() and figure() or uiaxes() and uifigure().


demotitle:

"crosshair" - A draggable crosshair is drawn; its movements are limited so that
    its center never leaves the axes. This is the default demo.

"dragtest" - Some graphical objects (such as rectangles, lines, patches and
    plots) are drawn, following various constraints. For more details, please
    read the comments in the source code.

"snapgrid" - An example on how to use draggable"s "motionfcn" argument so that a
    draggable object snaps to a grid.

"polymove" - A polygon with draggable vertices is drawn; draggable"s "motionfcn"
    argument is used to redraw the polygon each time a vertex is moved.

"sliders" - A set of vertical sliders are created; a single call to draggable is
    used for all sliders since they share the same parameters. A "motionfcn"
    argument is used to update the displayed slider values.


mode:

"axes" - Draw demo in axes() and figure() objects.

"uiaxes" - Draw demo in uiaxes() and uifigure() objects.
